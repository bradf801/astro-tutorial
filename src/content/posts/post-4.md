Hello, this post was created to test the `Astro.glob()` functionality on the [Blog page](../blog).

## Why that's cool

1. **Components!**: Components enable the fuctionality of a lot of the development that goes into building pages in the Astro framework.

2. **Glob**: The Glob functionallity pulls data from other parts of the website and creates a dynamic list of blog posts

## What's next

I will quit my day job to build websites.
